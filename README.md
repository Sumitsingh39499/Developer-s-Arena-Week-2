Sections Overview
About Me

Brief introduction highlighting my background as a BTech Computer Science (Data Science) student with an interest in web development.

Skills

Full Stack Development (learning phase)

JavaScript

REST APIs

MongoDB

Postman API

Contact

A simple contact form layout with:

Name field

Email field

Message textarea
(Note: Form submission is not connected to a backend)

What This Project Is (and Is Not)

This project is:

A frontend portfolio layout

A foundation for future improvement

Suitable for beginners and early-stage learners

This project is NOT:

A full-stack application

Connected to a backend or database

Production-ready

Being clear about this shows maturity.

Future Improvements

If you’re serious about web development, this is what you should add next:

Convert layout to semantic HTML

Fix invalid HTML (your <li> nesting is wrong)

Improve accessibility (labels, contrast, font choices)

Add JavaScript for form handling

Connect contact form to a backend (Node.js / Express)

Deploy properly using GitHub Pages or Netlify

Until you do these, don’t call this “full-stack” anywhere.
